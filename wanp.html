        <h1>Why a new protocol?</h1>
    </head>
    <body>
        Existing protocols cover a number of different tasks.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Mail protocols allow the transfer of transient messages from a single author 
            to a small number of recipients, at the request of the author.</li>
            <li>File transfer protocols allow the transfer of data at the request of either the sender
             or receiver, but allow little processing of the data at the responding side.</li>
            <li>News protocols allow the broadcast of transient data to a wide audience.</li>
            <li>Search and Retrieve protocols allow index searches to be made, and allow document 
            access. Few exist: Z39.50 is one and could be extended for our needs.</li>
        </ul>
         The protocol we need for information access (<a href="file:///C:/Users/sreer/OneDrive
         /Desktop/learnPython/.vscode/proposed.html">HTTP)</a> must provide.
         <ul>
            <li>A subset of the file transfer functionality</li>
            <li>The ability to request an index search</li>
            <li>Automatic format negotiation.</li>
            <li>The ability to refer the client to another server</li>
         </ul>
