        <p>
            The definition of this protocol is in the public domain(see <a href="./policy.html">policy</a>).
        </p>
        <h2> Underlying protocol</h2>
        <p>
        Current HTTP uses ASCII transmission over a telnet-style internet protocol, to make it
         simple to program, so that it will catch on: conversion to run over an OSI stack will
          be simple as the structure of the messages is well defined.
        </p>
        <h2>Idempotent</h2>
        <p>
            This protocol is stateless, in that no state is kept by the server onn behalf of the client.
            (This does not rule out caching by the server internally.)
        </p>
        <h2>Request: Information transferred from client</h2>
        <p>
            Parameters below, however represented on the network, are given in upper case, with 
            parameter names in lower case. This set assumes a model of format negociation in which
             in which the client says what he can take, and the server decides what to give him. 
             One imagines that each function would return a status, as well as information specified below.<br>
            When running over a byte stream protocol, SGML would be an encoding possibility (as well as ASN/1 etc).<br>
            GET document_name <a href="./htro.html">HTRO</a>.<br>
            &nbsp; Please transfer a named document back. Transfer the results back in a standard format or one which I have 
            said I can accept.<br>
            Request<br>
            SEARCH keywords<br>
        &nbsp; Please search the given index document for all items with the given word combination, and
             transfer the results back as marked up hypertext. This could elaborate to an SQL query.
              There are many advantages in making the search criterion just a subset of the document
               name space.<br>
            SINCE datetime<br>
        &nbsp; For a search, refer to documents only dated on or after this date. Used typically
                for building a journal, or for incremental update of indexes and maps of the web.<br>
                BEFORE datetime<br>
        &nbsp; For a search, refer to documents before this date only.
            ACCEPT format penalty
        &nbsp; I can accept the given formats. The penalty
                is a set of numbers giving an estimate of the data degradation and elapsed time 
                penalty which would be suffered at the CLIENT end by data being received in the way.
                Gateways may add or modify these fields.<br>
            PORT<br>
        &nbsp; We could change the default so that if the port command is not specified,
        then data must be sent back down the same link. In an idempotent world, this information 
        would be included in the GET command.<br>
            HEAD doc<br>
        &nbsp; Like GET, but get only header information. One would have to decide whether the header
            should be in SGML or in protocol format (e.g. RPC parameters or internet mail header
            format). The function of this would be to allow overviews and simple indexes to be built
            without having to retrieve the whole document. 
             HEAD command. The process of generation of the header of a document from the source (if
            that is how it is derived) is subject to the same possibilties (caching, etc) as a format
             convertion from the source.<br>
            USER id<br>
        &nbsp; The user name for logging purposes, preferably a mail address. Not for authentication 
            unless no other authentication is given.<br>
            AUTHORITY authentication<br>
        &nbsp; A string to be passed across transparently. The protocol is open to the authentication 
        system used.<br> 
            HOST<br>
        &nbsp; The calling host name - useful when the host is not properly registered with the
        name server.<br>
            Client Software<br>
        &nbsp; For interest only, the application name and version number of the client software. 
        These values should be preserved by the gateways.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Response</h2>
        <p> Suppose the response is an SGML document, with the document type a function
            of the status.(<a href="./Example.html">Example</a>)
            Status<br>
        &nbsp; A status is required in machine-readable format. See the 3-figure status codes of 
        FTP for example. Bad status codes should be accompanied by an explantory document, 
        possible conianing links to futher information. A possibility would be to make an error
         response a special SGML document type. Some special status codes are mentioned below .<br>
            Format<br>
        &nbsp; The format selected by the server<br>
            Document<br>
        &nbsp; The document in that format<br>
        </p>
        <h2> Status codes</h2>
        <p>
            Success<br>
        &nbsp; Accompanied by format and document.<br>
            Forward<br>
        &nbsp; Accompanied by new address. The server indicates a new address to be used by the 
        client for finding the document. the document may have moved, or the server may be a
         name server.<br>
            Need Authorisation<br>
        &nbsp; The authorisation is not sufficient. Accompanied by the address prefix for which
         authorisation is required. The browser should obtain authoisation, and use it every time
          a request is made for a document name matching that prefix.<br>
            Refused<br>
        &nbsp; Access has been refused. Sending (more) authorization won't help.<br>
            Bad document name<br>
        &nbsp; The document name did not refer to a valid document.<br>
            Server failure<br>
        &nbsp; Not the client's fault. Accompanied by a natural language explanation.<br>
            Not available now<br>
        &nbsp; Temporary problem - trying at a later time might help. This does not imply anything
         about the document name and authorisation being valid. Accompaned by a natural language
          explaination.<br>
            Search fail<br>
        &nbsp;    Accompanied by a HTML hit-list without any hits, but possibly containing a 
        natural explanation.<br>
        <br>
