        Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.<br>
        Hypertext is text which contains links to other texts. The term was coined 
        by <a href="file:///C:/Users/sreer/OneDrive/Desktop/learnPython/TedNelson.html"> Ted 
        Nelson </a> around 1965(see <a href="file:///C:/Users/sreer/OneDrive/Desktop/learnPython/history.html"> history</a>).<br>
        Hypermedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include
        graphics, video and sound, for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was first to use this term too.<br><br>
        Hypertext and Hypermedia are concepts , not products.<br>
