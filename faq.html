        An FAQ list is really a cop-out from managed information. You should be able to find everything you want to know by browsing from  the 
        WWW project page, as everything should be arranged in a logical way. Here though are things which maybe didn't fit into the structure,
        with pointers to the answers which maybe did. Its an experiment, started on May 92. The questions are anonymous.<br><br>
