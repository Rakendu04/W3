            This discussion on link topology differetiates between systems with mon-directional
             and those with bidirection links. In practice, a system
in which different parts of the web have different capabilities cannot insist on bidirectional
 links.<br>

Imagine, for example the publisher of a large and famous book to which many people refer
 but who has no interest in maintaining his end of their links or indeed in knowing who
  has refered to the book. In this case the link may be only of use to the person who made it.<br>

However, there are cases in which the back-links are of great interest, and so they may be
 generated off line.<br>

<h2>How?</h2>
One way is for a daemon to read all of the documenst on a particular domain, and make a database
 of the links, then redistribute to the servers the back links.<br>
Another way is suggested by Phillip Hallam-Baker who "wondered about a tag being added to the 
get protocol to indicate where the text was being accessed from. This could then be used by
 intelligent servers to create back links - if this was desired. This would allow the wed
  to grow dynamicaly since I would know that logging onto any "key" W3 server I would be
   able to travel to all those parts of the web I was meant to..."<br>

This method would also provide intersting statistics on the use of particular links, 
which would enhance the usage logging.
