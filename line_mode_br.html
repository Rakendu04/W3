        One of several browsers of the WWW project. The LineModeBrowser is suitable for use 
        on dumb terminals, requiring no control sequences except for carriage return and 
        line feed. It is also ofcourse useable from terminal emulators in workstation windows. 
        It can also be used as a text formatter, as part of a mail server, and as a general 
        information retrieval tool.<br>
