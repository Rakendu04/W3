        The WorldWideWeb system can pick up information from many information sources, using 
        existing protocols. Among these are file and news transfer protocols.<br><br>
        <h2>The Transfer</h2>>
        The file transfer protocol currently most used for accessing fairly stable public 
        information over a wide area is "Anonymous FTP". This means the use of the internet 
        File Transfer Protocol without authentication. As the WWW project currently operates 
        for the sake of public information, anonymous FTP is quite appropriate, and WWW can 
        pick up any information provided by anonymous FTP. FTP is defined in RFC 959 which 
        includes material from many previous RFCs. (See also: file address syntax ). Directories 
        are browsed as hypertext. The browser will notice references to files which are in
         fact accessible as locally mounted (or on DECnet on VMS systems) and use direct access 
         instead.<br><br>
         <h2>Network News</h2>
         The "Network News Transfer Protocol" (NNTP) is defined in RFC 977 by Kantor and
          Lampsley. This allows transient news information in the USENET news format to 
          be exchanged over the internet. The format of news articles is defined in RFC 850,
           Standard for Interchange of USENET Messages by Mark Horton. This in turn refers 
           to the standard RFC 822 which defines the format of internet mail messages. News 
           articles make good examples of hypertext, as articles contain references to other
            articles and news groups. News groups appear like directories, but more informative.<br><br>
           <h2>Search and Retrieve</h2>
           The WWW project defines its own protocol for information transfer, called HTTP, for
            HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is a very simple internet protocol, similar in
             implementation to FTP and NNTP. The HTTP client sends a document identifier with
              or without search words, and the server responds with hypertext or plain text. 
              Extensions are foreseen to allow for more elaborate queries and format negotiation
              . The protocol runs over TCP, using one connection per document request. The
               browser acts as a pipeline, so that as data arrives from the server, it is 
               presented to the reader on the fly.<br>
            Whilst the HTTP protocol provides a simple keyword search function, a famous search
            -and-retrieve protocol is Z39.50, and the version of it used by the WAIS project.
             (See also the WAIS-WWW gateway).<br><br>
             <h2>Gopher</h2>
             The Gopher distributed information system uses a lightweight protocol very similar 
             to HTTP. Therefore, it is now included in every WWW client, so that the Gopher
              world can be browsed as part of the Web. Gopher menus are easily mapped onto 
              hypertext links. Chances are that future versions of the Gopher and HTTP protocols
               will converge.
