        <h1>W3 Server Software</h1>
    </head>
    <body>
        A W3 server, like the ftp daemon , is a program which responds to an incoming 
        tcp connection and provides a service to the caller.There are many varieties
         of W3 server software to serve different forms of data.<br><br>
         <h2>The Basic Daemon</h2>
         The basic daemon
        The basic W3 daemon program serves files already in hypertext or plain text.
         This daemon then is used as a basis for many other types of server and gateway.
          Documentation includes:<br>
        <ul>
        <li>User guide.</li>
        <li>Internals -- a description of the code.</li>
        Much of the above may also apply in whole or part to other servers mentioned below.
         Whatever server you are running, you will probably be interested in:<br>
         <li>Tools for information providers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Making a new server</h2>
        This daemon is often used as a basis for a more specific server for a given 
        application. A server which allows a world of data to be seen as part of the 
        W3 universe is known as a gateway. (Most servers could therefore be regarded
         as gateways, but the term implies some conversion or mapping between dissimilar
          worlds) . For short tutorials with examples, see:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>Writing a server in C</li>
            <li>Writing a server as a script</li>
          </ul>
          It is a good idea to pick the basic daemon or one of the servers below as a starting  
          point when making a new server.<br>
          <h2>Other servers and gateways</h2>
          These are servers which provide data extracted from other systems. They are built 
          using code from the basic daemon, or scripts.<br>
          <h2>FIND gateway</h2>
          For CERN/VM XFIND which calls a REXX exec to get the information from
           the XFIND system running on the CERNVM mainframe.<br>
            VMS Help gateway<br>
            This allows any VMS help files to be made available to WWW clients. Runs on VAX/VMS.<br>
            WAISGate<br>
            A gateway to information available using the W.A.I.S. protocol.<br>
            DCLServer<br>
            A server for VMS systems which allows you to write a gateway to your own favorite
             information system using DCL.<br>
            System33<br>
            A (big) csh script server providing data including Xerox System33 documents, 
            man pages in plain text, phone numbers, etc. etc...<br>
            Oracle<br>
            A generic server to oracle. Could be used as a basis for gateways to specific
             Oracle databases.<br>
            Geography<br>
            Gateway to the<br>
            Geography server at U Michigan<br><br>
